## Data Source

This application uses [**NewsAPI**](https://newsapi.org/) â€” a RESTful API that aggregates news from various sources and publishers worldwide. It supports queries, filters, and sorting to fetch up-to-date, relevant news articles.

---

## Dependencies

The following third-party packages were integrated:

- [`url_launcher`](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher): To open article URLs in a web browser.
- [`intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl): To format and present article publication dates clearly.
- [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences): For saving search history, bookmarks, and read articles persistently across sessions.
- [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): For effective state management throughout the app.

---

## Local Data Persistence

The app uses `shared_preferences` to store:
- User search queries
- List of bookmarked articles
- List of read articles

This enables consistent user experience, even after closing or restarting the app.

## Developer Notes

This project was a valuable hands-on experience in real-world app design, data handling, state management, and testing. I enjoyed connecting real-time APIs with a well-designed UI, and learned a lot about debugging, persistence, and improving UX based on edge cases (e.g., missing data). Future improvements could include fixing test ambiguity, expanding platform compatibility, and enhancing UI accessibility.
